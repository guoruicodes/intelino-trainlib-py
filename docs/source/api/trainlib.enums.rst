Enums (constants)
=================

Intead of arbitrary hex numbers we prefer using properly typed enums. They are
a bit longer to write, but the benefits (clarity and type safety) are worth it.

.. automodule:: trainlib.enums
   :members: ButtonPress, ColorSensor, MovementDirection, SnapColorValue, SpeedLevel, SteeringDecision, StopDrivingFeedbackType
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :member-order: bysource
