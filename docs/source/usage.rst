Usage and Examples
==================

Now you're ready to start using the library!

To help you get started and familiarize you with the library and
the smart train, we created a collection of examples. They will show you
how to control the train's basic functions including movement, speed,
navigation on the track, LEDs, etc. You will learn about enabling train
event listeners and interactively programming multiple trains. You will also
be able to use these examples as seed programs to experiment with your
own ideas.

You can read and browse our example repository at:
https://github.com/intelino-code/intelino-trainlib-py-examples

To be able to run it locally and experiment by modifying the code,
you can download the examples here:
